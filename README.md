# AwayMute
A fabric mod that mutes Minecraft when its window becomes unfocused and restores the original volume when refocused.

(explicitly targeting 1.17.1, but might be compatible with other versions?)

An update of FocusSoundToggleMod, a 1.12.2 forge mod I wrote that does the same thing.

Also, my first fabric mod :)
